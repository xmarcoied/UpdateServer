/*
UpdateServer package ships releases and manage update requests

Prerequisites

Before diving into the install section ensure you have:
	- Postgresql
	- golang (1.5 or later)

Installing

Nothing fancy, just use teh golang go get
$ go get code.videolan.org/GSoC2017/Marco/UpdateServer

Configuration

The configuration comes in JSON format, you either edit the default config.json attached or give the path of the configuration file through flags Example :

{
  "psqlinfo": {
      "psqlhost"     : "host" ,
      "psqlname"     : "updater" ,
      "psqluser"     : "postgres" ,
      "psqlpassword" : "postgres" ,
      "psqlport"     : "5432"
  }
}

Flags

The UpdateServer uses -port flag to customize port web application will be running on (8080 default)

and -config to add a path for the configuration file

Usage

cd $GOPATH/src/code.videolan.org/GSoC2017/Marco/UpdateServer

go build to build a binary UpdateServer

./UpdateServer to run the Server

Optional flags:

./UpdateServer -port 80
./UpdateServer -config $HOME/config.json
Default admin authentication : username:admin , password:admin

<host>/admin/dashboard/channels to add new channel .

[secure] Add only public key, and sign the metadata at every release's action.

[less secure] Add both public and private key, and the server would auto-sign the releases .

<host>/admin/dashboard/releases to add new release

insert the needed fields and choose a channel and you can add rules against it later .

add <host>/u/update to you client with a querystring for the update_request paramaters.

Example : <host>/u/update?product=vlc&channel=stable&os=Win&os_ver=7&os_arch=64&product_ver=2.1.4

Expected release content :

{"id":17,"channel":"stable","os":"Linux","os_ver":"Linux","os_arch":"32","product_ver":"2.1.1","url":"localhost","title":"Title","desc":"Description","product":"vlc"}

Note: the signed status is the JSON release without ID field.

so, at verifying the releases at client remove the "id":<id>, part .

also add <host>/u/signature to get the signature for the associated release

Example : <host>/u/signature?id=<release_id>

Monitor the incoming update_requests through <host>/u/requests
